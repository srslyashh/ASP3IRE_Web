Wildfire Smoke,"Wildfire smoke pertains to a mixture of harmful air pollutants, such as particulate matter, water vapor, and carbon dioxide, among others emitted into the air as a result of the combustion of wood. The composition of wildfire smoke can vary based on the type and makeup of wood. Wildfire smoke is a hazard to human health because of the fine particles present in the smoke that can easily penetrate deep into the lungs. Since their bodies are still growing and developing, children are at a greater risk of the effects of wildfire smoke since they are exposed to more pollution per pound of body weight than compared to adults. Wildfire smoke exposure as a child can cause numerous negative health outcomes, including lung infections, asthma, developmental delays and even psychological/emotional distress.

Radon,"Radon is a radioactive chemical gas that has no odor, color or taste and is released from natural materials, such as soil, water and rocks. Radon can be found in buildings, as it can enter through cracks in walls, dirt floors, foundations, and other openings, leading to exposure to the human body via inhalation and ingestion. Children are particularly at risk to radon exposure because of their small lung size, causing their breathing rates to be higher, thus making them more susceptible to its harmful effects. Exposure to radon can significantly increase a child’s risk of developing lung cancer.",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1476469535352-80159d0af31d?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1172&q=80,4,"RADON Risk in Oregon

Children’s Blood Lead Levels,"The total amount of lead detected in children’s blood is representative of blood lead levels. Lead is a heavy metal that can  be found in several different sources including lead dust, plumbing, and children’s products, among others.

For children, lead can be particularly harmful because their growing bodies will absorb more lead than compared to adults, making them more vulnerable to its effects. Lead exposure as a child is harmful as it can disrupt neurological and physical development, leading to adverse developmental outcomes later in life, such as learning disorders and behavioral problems.

Air Toxics,"Air toxics are harmful pollutants that can cause cancer and other serious health issues if an individual is exposed. There are many different types of air pollutants, which can be emitted from manmade sources like automobiles and industrial processes, as well as from natural sources via wildfires and other natural events. Specifically, children are at an increased risk of experiencing the negative effects of air toxics because they are exposed to more pollution per pound of body weight compared to adults, they are actively  developing physically, and they typically spend more time outdoors than adults. Exposure to air toxics and pollutants during childhood can lead to health outcomes such as, respiratory infections, disruptions in lung growth, increased risk of chronic diseases, as well as cognitive and developmental impairments.",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1607225124466-bc9c7edeb59d?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1170&q=80,3,"Oregon DEQ Air Quality

Contaminated Sites,"Contaminated sites are areas of land that contain harmful chemicals and hazardous materials. A site becomes contaminated when toxic materials, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are deposited into an area. Contamination can occur via natural events like hurricanes and man-made sources like industrial factories. These chemicals and hazardous materials can contaminate land, air, ground, and surface water. Exposure to harmful materials from contaminated sites poses threats to all individuals, however, children are more vulnerable to their effects. Children are still developing physically and cognitively and breathe more air and intake more water per pound of body weight than adults. Thus exposure could inhibit this process and lead to long-term health consequences, such as developmental disabilities and cancer.",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559564100-08eac4679dc5?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=735&q=80,4,"Oregon DEQ Environmental Cleanup Program
